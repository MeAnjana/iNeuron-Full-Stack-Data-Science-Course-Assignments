1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

    *          :expression
    
   'hello'     :value
   
   -87.8       :value
   
   -           :expression
   
   /           :expression
   
   +	         :expression
   
   6           :value
   
   
2. What is the difference between string and variable?

      String - A String is a type of information you would store in a Variable. A String is usually words, enclosed with "".

      Variable - A Variable is a store of information. 


3. Describe three different data types.

      String - A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. 

      Tuple - Tuple is an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified               after it is created.

      List - List is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
             List is represented using square brackets[].

      Integers - It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). 


4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

      An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.
      Expressions will be mathematical operators.

            Operators:		Operator:

            +	             and
            â€“	              or
            *	             not
            /	
            //	
            %	
            **



5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

      An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.

      Statements represent an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statements. 
      Expression is a combination of variables, operations and values that yields a result value.


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
      bacon = 22
      bacon + 1


7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
       'spam' + 'spamspam'
       'spam' * 3

    
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

         Because variable names cannot start with a number.

         A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
         A variable name cannot start with a number. 
         A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
         Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

      The int() , float() , and str( ) functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
       'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

      This expression causes an error because a str can only concatenate to str (not "int") .
      We can fix it by converting the integer value into a string.(By putting double or single quotes to the integer value).
